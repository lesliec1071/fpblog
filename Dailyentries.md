## Blog Entry # 1						     Date: 12/6/19


Today I created a directory about my topic and created files for my subtopics. In the files I wrote down my research for that subtopic. I finished one file and eagan to work on my second file. 

I learned how cures and treatments impact society based on social and economic aspect.

I used sources from google.

A skill that I used was learning how to organize all my information and collabartion with my peers.
